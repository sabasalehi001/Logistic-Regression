Overview
This repository contains Python code for creating a logistic regression model based on the marketing campaign data of a Portuguese banking institution. The goal of this classification model is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable 'y').

Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the work of [Moro et al., 2014], titled "A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing." The data provides insights into the success of telemarketing campaigns conducted by the banking institution.

Instructions
Data Retrieval:
The bank marketing data is loaded from the provided source. The first column of the dataset serves as the index.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Explore and preprocess the data as needed. Handle any missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform necessary transformations.

Feature Selection:
Define the features (independent variables) and the target variable ('y').

Train-Test Split:
Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Standardization:
Standardize the data to ensure consistency in feature scales.

Logistic Regression Model:
Create and train a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Running the Code
Clone this repository and execute the provided Python script to run the logistic regression model on the bank marketing data. Ensure you have the required libraries installed by using:

pip install pandas scikit-learn
